###Python installation

python.org
Downloads > Windows > Python 3.6.7 > Download windows x86 executable installer > Double click on the installer and click on run > Check add python path (check box) 


### Architecture
1. Hardware
2. Kernel
3. Shell
4. Application
5. User data

Kernel - It has some predefined compilers OR it is a collection of compilers, Which is responsible for the interaction between harware and the user
		 To make python to work we need to add interpreter at kernel
		 
Types of compilers 
		1. Compiler - Compiler which converts whole program at a time or at once 
		2. Interpreter - Which converts the code line by line 

*** Pyton makes use of interpreter

Python editors
	IDE - Integrated Development Environement
	IDLE -  Integrated Development and Learning Environement

	Python use IDLE
	
Memory -  Memory is a place where the data is stored, It is divided into blocks where the blocks can contain bits of data or bytes of data
Variable-  Variables is the named memory location 
		* Each and every variable can store value or the address
		
 SYNTAX to define a variables ---  VariableName = Value
 
 Exampes of variable a=10 , b=1 
 
 If more than one value is stored then it is stored as a "TUPLE" example a=1,2,3
 
Identifiers -- The variable name is known as identifier which identifies the memory

Rules to define Identifiers 
	Identifiers must always start with the character or underscore (_)
	It can be a combination of alphabet and numbers (but should never start with number)
	Identifier cannot be a numeric value because one integer value cannot define another integer value
	Idnetifiers should not start with/contain special characters except _
	Keywords cannot be used as identifiers

	bad syntax  examples 1=20; a@b=211; if=12
	
	
Keywords -  they are the reserved words which has some predefined meaning
import keyword
IDLE>>> keyword.kwlist
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

Data Type -- Data type which specifies the type of data to be stored and also which is used to convert the data from one data type to another data type
